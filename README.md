The repository contains the trainig, testing, and visualization codes for the research paper on extremely light weight segmentation models. The model architecture has not yet been uploaded and will be uploaded once the paper gets public. Until then kindly look at the model outputs obtained on the crack segmentation dataset as well as on body segmentation dataset. The model size is 1.5 MB which is extremely light weight in comparison to the existing CNN architectures.
